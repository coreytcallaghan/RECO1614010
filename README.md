# Valuation of vagrant birds
A repository with data and code to reproduce the analysis of Callaghan et al. 2019. "[Birds are valuable: the case of vagrants](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14724049.2019.1614010)".

Note that the use of gmapsdistance is a more difficult process because of google locking down on API usage. For more information, see [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/gmapsdistance/versions/1.0/topics/gmapsdistance). This repository is archived with zenodo.
